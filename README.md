# ETC5523 Assessment 1

This is the **Dairy production and consumption** app for the ETC5523 Assessment 1. 

* The creator of this app is `Harsh Katiyar`.
* The data used for this assessment is the `Dairy Production and Consumption Data` data. 

The goal of the app is to study and visualize the statistics of MILK PRODUCTION from 1970-2017 to explain the trend of milk production in different regions of USA and their states. The app will also show the total milk production per year.

In the second part of the app, a column graph is used to show the total fluid milk sales/consumption per year and in the last part of the app, the purpose is to study the statistics of each dairy product consumption per person from 1975 to 2017 with better visualization. 

From the above statistical and mathematical calculation, one can find out the relationship between Milk production, fluid milk sales/consumption and dairy products cosumption.
