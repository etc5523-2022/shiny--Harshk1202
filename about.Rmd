variousregions and states of United States from 1970 to 2017 
and consumption of different dairy products from 1975 to 2017 
(in pounds per person) in United States.

The data source is from **tidytuesday (2019)** 



#### Purpose

The purpose of the app is to:

1. show the comparison between milk production statistics and dairy products consumption over the period,
2. show how the use of **plotly** function in plots make visualization of the data much more striking and easy to interpret, and 
3. help the user to look at the data, understand the data and visualize the data for each year and make a decision accordingly.

The data showed that there was not much increase or decrease in milk production in different regions but there were some specific dairy products which showed increase and decrease in their consumption over the time and the column graph is showing this trend very clearly including values as well.
